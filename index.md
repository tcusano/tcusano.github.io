# About This Site

I have decided to create this site is for a number of reasons: 
 1. It's a way to share some of my experiences,tips and gotcha's with fellow IT personel or super users (can't leave them out).
 2. It's way for me to learn another exciting tool, Jekyll, upon which this site is built.  <img title="my sample page" src="images/jekyll.png" />
 3. To advertise any new products I develop.

# Coming Up soon

I am very excited to announce a new tool called "OraDB Migration Tool" which I have been working on for the past 15 months (on and off in my spare time). 
The product is still in testing phase but documentation can be previewed <a href='oracle_migration_tool.html'>here</a>.

The reason I started to write this migration tool was really to achieve two things. The first was to learn Python and the second to have a tool to migrate Oracle database from on premise to the Cloud or to another server on premise, making the DBA life hassle free!
