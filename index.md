## This Site
My ambition for this site is to provide useful tools and tips to fellow IT collegues. I shall be adding more to site in due course. 


## About me in brief
I started working in IT in 1988 and since then I have been working on many different systems. I have been working with Oracle databases for over 20 years and I moved into DEVOPS over a year ago and I am really enjoying this new role as there are many new challeges and much more scripting.
